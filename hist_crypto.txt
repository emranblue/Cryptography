Cryptology was well established in ancient times, with both Greeks and
Romans practicing different forms of cryptography. With the fall of the Roman
Empire, cryptology was largely lost in the West until the Renaissance, but it flour-
ished in the Arabic world. The Arabs invented the first reliable tool for cryptanaly-
sis, frequency analysis. With the end of the Middle Ages and the increase in
commerce and diplomacy, cryptology enjoyed a Renaissance of it’s own in the
West

Julius Caesar, probably the greatest of all Roman generals, was no stranger to cryp-
tology. In his famous Commentary on the Gallic Wars, Caesar himself describes
using a form of a cipher to hide a message If he had anything confidential to say, he wrote it in cipher, that is, by so changing the order of the
letters of the alphabet, that not a word could be made out. If anyone wishes to deci-
pher these, and get at their meaning, he must substitute the fourth letter of the alpha-
bet, namely D, for A, and so with the others.” (Seutonius 1957, Ch. 56) This is the
first written description of the modern monoalphabetic substitution cipher using a
shifted standard alphabet. Using Caesar’s cipher, the cipher alphabet looks like
Plain: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
Cipher: DEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABC
